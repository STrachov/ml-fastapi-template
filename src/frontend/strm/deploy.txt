1. Deploy the Streamlit App on an AWS Service
You can use services like Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Amazon Lightsail to deploy your app. Here’s a quick guide using EC2 as an example:

Set up an EC2 instance:
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that supports Python (e.g., Ubuntu).
Select an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for small apps).
Configure security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic on port 8501 (Streamlit’s default port).
Install dependencies on the EC2 instance:
SSH into the instance, then install Python, Streamlit, and other dependencies.
Upload your app files (or clone from a Git repository).
Run the Streamlit app on the EC2 instance:
Start the app with streamlit run frontend/login.py --server.port 8501 --server.enableCORS false.
You may want to run the app in a background process, such as using nohup or a process manager like screen.
2. Configure a Public IP or DNS Name for Easy Access
Once your app is running on AWS, you’ll have a public IP address or a DNS name associated with the EC2 instance. For example, if your instance’s public IP is 54.123.45.67, users can access the app at http://54.123.45.67:8501.

To provide a more user-friendly link, consider setting up a custom domain with Amazon Route 53 or another DNS provider. This allows you to map your app’s IP to a domain like login.yourapp.com.
3. Send the Shareable Link
You can send the direct link to users, e.g., http://your-public-ip-or-domain:8501. If you have a custom domain, this would look like http://login.yourapp.com.

Example of How This Would Work:
Assuming the app is accessible at http://54.123.45.67:8501:

Send Link: Share http://54.123.45.67:8501 or your custom domain link with other users.
User Access: When users visit the link, they’ll see the Streamlit-based login form you created.
Securing the Application
To protect your application:

Enable HTTPS: Use a reverse proxy like NGINX or set up an SSL certificate for secure HTTPS connections. AWS Load Balancers and CloudFront can help manage SSL for custom domains.
Authentication: Ensure sensitive routes are protected by requiring login tokens, as your FastAPI backend handles.
